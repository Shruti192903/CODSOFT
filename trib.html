            <h2>Indira Gandhi</h2>
            <p>
            <ul><class="curved-round"></class>
               
                <li>I admire this person for their incredible kindness, unwavering determination,and positive attitude.
                Their dedication to achieving their goals inspires me to work harder and never give up on my dreams.
                They are a true role model and a source of inspiration in my as well as everyone's life.<br></li>
            
                <li>Indira Gandhi was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as third Prime Minister of India
                from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was born on November 19, 1917, in Allahabad,
                British India (now in Uttar Pradesh, India), and was the only child of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India,
                and Kamala Nehru.<br></li>

                <li>>Indira Gandhi's political career began when she became a member of the Indian National Congress party in
                the early 1950s. She served in various roles within the party and the government before becoming the Prime
                Minister of India for the first time in 1966, following the death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. She was the first
                woman to hold the office of Prime Minister in India.<br></li>

                <li> During her tenure as Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi implemented several significant policies and
                initiatives, including nationalization of banks and various industries, land reforms, and the "Garibi Hatao" (Eradicate
                Poverty) campaign.However, her leadership also faced criticism and controversy, particularly for her declaration of a
                state of emergency from 1975 to 1977, during which civil liberties were suspended, political opponents were arrested, and
                censorship was imposed.<br></li>

                <li>In 1980, after a period of political turmoil, Indira Gandhi returned to power as Prime Minister after
                the Congress party's victory in the general elections. However, on October 31, 1984, she was assassinated by her own
                bodyguards in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, a military operation aimed at removing militants from the Golden
                Temple in Amritsar, Punjab.<br></li>

                <li>Indira Gandhi's legacy remains complex and contentious. While she is admired for her strong leadership
                and contributions to India's development, she is also criticized for her authoritarian style of governance during the
                emergency period.Nevertheless, she remains an iconic figure in Indian politics and is remembered as one of the most
                influential leaders in the country's history. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, later became the Prime Minister of India after her
                assassination.<br></li>
